Didnt want convo by looks of it lol
"So why go on tinder if you don’t wanna talk, that’s what gets me."
"She has absolutely NO interest in talking to you. at all. Just , move on."
"“I study animals…speaking of animals, did you know ducks have evolved a complex vagina with several dead-end pockets and tunnels in order to confuse unwanted mates and prevent fertilization from the wrong male”"
Conversation never started to begin with
"Her answers kinda seem like .. “duh? you should know this already?” At that point, it’s easier to just not respond."
"Ye I thought that and partly the reason I wanted a second opinion, thank you"
The conversation was never alive in the first place since all life needs water
"She killed it at “not really” my man was a full on surgeon trying to revive this conversation back to life but alas, it was doomed to begin with"
"Sounds like she needs to study more, cause she doesn't even know what she's supposed to be learning?"
Guessing that topic wasn't sending any sparks man.
Well there was nothing else on her profile or anything else to talk about
"Wdym, “not uni?”"
I don’t know what Americans call it but College in England is the step before University but after High school
"He's just trying to show interest in her and idk but yall but when I love my job I enjoy bragging a bit. She could've changed the subject and not been rude. He was just trying more than the boring ""hey whats up how are you"""
Thank you for noticing
She's giving you dull answers because she's not interested in where you're directing the conversation.
"Small talk can be tedious, especially for women as they have 50+ other guys asking the same thing."
Usually talking about someone's choice in profession is a safe way to get them to open up and talk about what excites them. She seems very dull.
This is 80% of the conversations I have on Tinder🤦🏻‍♀️ And I thought I was the problem this whole time lmaoo
"Off topic here, but I just noticed your username."
Can we create a lesbo tinder sub? Bc the situations discussed in r/ Tinder/Bumble/Hinge typically do not apply to my life at all.
"Like, we aren’t even considered."
Ye you’re probably not boring don’t worry
"This may be obvious to people with a brain,but folks shouldn’t match if they plan to have a shitty conversation like this. Of course,someone somewhere will say “why didn’t he ask open ended questions.” Uh,no. An adult should realize where there’s an opportunity to elaborate on their answers ffs 😂"
Thank you so much
"I think that vague/obviously initial question killed the conversation. Like maybe if you worded it like ""is there a lot of theory work involved?"" Or ""what type of animals?"" Instead of ""what does that involve?"" She wouldn't have thought she was talking to an idiot who didn't know that animal care means caring for animals and get turned off from the conversation."
"Can't believe you had the patience to keep texting, I would have left after ""not really"" 🙄"
"I dont normally comment on posts, but I do think I think I have some things I can add."
"I do believe she wasn't that interested in you, or the app, or she was having a bad day, whatever; I dont think it matters.. what does matter is that every situation has two contributors, and every situation can be learned from. You are the only one I can reach so I'll only address things you can change for next time."
"I've seen alot of good points so far, for one I agree that you should try to use more open ended questions as it creates room to generate better conversation. (See alot of the great responses for examples)"
"Tldr: Have a fun conversation that doesn't involve getting to know them, save that for the date."
"""How do you look after farm animals if you let other people carry everything?"""
Some people are so strange. Actual real life NPC.
She's rhe kind of person who expect everyone to know the same things they know and get mad about it if you dont know what they're talkimg about
It’s over for you after that conversation.  She wants nothing to do with you.
Not if she sees this karma
•You aren’t asking interesting questions/you’re interviewing her for a new position. •She isn’t interested
"So it’s the former, and the consequence is the latter.Try more playfulness in the texts.For example, when you ask if she has any interests, and she says no.You’d say “Oh come on, I know that’s impossible, I know you’re into x and y”x and y being fun activities you can pick from her photos, or make up fun activities if her photos/bio has nothing to link to."
Willing to bet there was next to nothing to go on from the profile.
"Yeah, no. Seeing this type of comment is the reason why some people show no interest/desire to develop a conversation. What you're suggesting to OP is basically to be an entertainer, but be mindful that is a two way road. Here, the respondent is pedantic and has shown no interest, whether he'd have asked the questions you're suggesting or not, that would have gone nowhere. I'm the kind of person that, if by my first question you show no reciprocity, I won't be your reason to be entertained because it's pointless."
"To continue to justify people's lack investment only encourages that behavior, so I'm good."
Yeah this is a big thing I keep seeing on here.
If it's something you might ask in a job interview. Don't ask it.
"If you're gonna ask about a job ask something like ""what's the wildest thing youve seen/done in your job"", not ""what are your roles/responsibilities"""
I think you were just a tad dim here. What else is animal care meant to mean? It means in general ;-;
"Bro its tinder, you need to flirt and stop talking like you're my aunt at a family gathering. Fucking school questions, Jesus dude"
What u be hitting them with
she sounds like a farm animal
"It was never alive to begin with. On to the next one, you did your best."
"Bro, that conversation was dead from the start. A for effort, but when someone responds like this, just move on. It’s not worth your time."
"Oh nice, the classic 2 or 3 words per sentence replies."
"I would have stopped replying after ""not really"""
Why is she using question marks like she doesn't know the answer to these basic questions?  LOL.
You'll have better success if you talk about something interesting instead
Your conversation skills are…. Lacking
"To be fair, you did ask her about animal theory"
"I get that you were trying to initiate a convo based off what was on her bio, but honestly she was probably turned off by conversations about school. Personally, school has me stressed enough as it is and the last place I want to have a convo about school is on tinder so she probably wasn’t feeling it."
This person had no interest carrying on a conversation.
"Ok I thought so, thanks for your perspective."
So many that have matched have had these dry conversational skills. I just stop responding
"she's probably chatting with 10 other guys at the same time, the burden is generally placed on guys, so she can get away with zero effort."
Yeah she's not in to you sorry. Either that or she suuuccckkksss at conversation.
Screw that. Dry ass responses. It’s not you man.
"Jeez, it's like talking to a rock."
"Some people suck at holding conversations through text. In situations like this I'd ask to meet for coffee, if they aren't game, I'd move on."
This should be in a “Welcome to Tinder” toturial 😂😂😂
"some ppl are just like this, had someone a week ago like this but a little worse and when I asked if the convo ever gets better she got mad"
it’s not you she’s being very dry
The conversation is boring as shit
Wasn't interested really.
"There is no way I would’ve responded to your original question. I think you killed it from the get-go. She’s there to entertain you? Let me be more constructive: Instead of asking her that, maybe say hi and here is something interesting about ME (you.)"
Damn some ppl just dont get how tinder works
"-uninteresting opener/topic of discussion -OP seeking conversation investment via barrage of questions, unless you’re in the 1%, this isn’t panning out"
"The conversation was too standard, this may have bored her. Probably many guys ask her abt her work, u should try to talk abt something more unusual next time. It probably wouldn't solve this especific conversation, but could help on the next ones."
It's you. How about instead of an interview you flirt a little? Just imagine how many times this woman has had to answer such questions. Next time try to be more flirty and stand out. I'm a man btw.
Well I'm pretty sure girls get way more matches on Tinder which means they have to sift through a lot more conversations.
"It probably is a lot of energy to reply in large sentences / paragraphs to every person, so I assume they are putting their energy into the conversations they find more interesting and are giving less energy and short replies to ones like this."
"Sorry OP, she might just not be that interested or is having a better convo with someone else but doesn't want to put all her eggs in one basket."
I would've unmatched after looking after animals.
There are plenty of smart fish in the sea...
"Slow feet don’t eat, whilst your asking questions someone else is offering to take her out or sending dick pics"
"I don’t know OP, you tell me? Also why are all of her answers questions and all of her questions answers? I don’t understand? Like WTF?"
"To be or not to be, that is the real question?"
Hello?
It was dead on arrival
"why do people make such a big deal out of this? just breath, count and count to ten call your grandma/aunt/mother and they will call you a handsome young man."
does this help your insecurity?
Should have given up after the second message
"A lot of people are assuming that she doesn’t want to talk to him. But if she didn’t want to talk to him, then why would she continue to talk to him? Personally, I think it’s more likely that she either lacks conversions skills or is feeling afraid of opening up to a stranger on the Internet. I’d recommend just continuing the conversation. You’re doing fine."
Yea she doesn't like you or doesn't have a personality suited to dating app communications. Either way
"She seemed almost hostile in her levels of disinterest. Just based on this exchange, I would say she's not interested."
"You community college is a thing in the US that basically functions like the college in Europe and the UK. It’s a 2-3 year program that should be started during your 11th or 12th year, but the US is dumb af."
This is why I don't have Tinder. I'm not good looking enough to get an easy date and talking just leads to this every time. I refuse to shower girls in compliments to get their attention. Probably why I was single for so long ;)
She became uninterested after the interrogation. I would’ve too.
I like your note to the burger people.
The burger people 😂 best comment I’ve seen all day
If you ask me what Animal Care involves I’m probably going to check out of the convo.
Maybe she doesn't know it either
"Just go ""Oh, because you need to take care of your sick mum?"""
"You can try leading with like ""You're so sweet, not many people would sacrifice the way you are"" when she asks what you mean, that's when you hit her with the mom joke."
"Been there done it, I just block them & move on."
So much of our society is soo hopelessly socially inept. Good luck out there boys and girls.
"What do you mean ""you americans"" ?"
You should say something hilarious about how much your back hurts from carrying the conversation. That's always so funny! Every time!
The question marks!  LOL.
Ask a different question bruh she redirected you already
It's you
dudes will really post a whole convo to reddit without realizing she just wasn’t interested
Yes
Yeah she killed it. She’s not cool. You are. I would have been enthusiastic. She’s lame.
I know I wasn’t the best but at least I tried I posted this because I wanted tips on what I could have done better
"You can tell she’s not interested. Someone who’s interested in talking to you, wouldn’t give bland answers or questions."
Can’t kill what was never alive in the first place. Hope your back doesn’t hurt from carrying the weight of that entire conversation
"Hey guys if she’s responding like this she wants to talk about something else, and by something else I mean something flirtatious. Some women don’t want to do small talk."
"It comea across as she killed the conversation indirectly, by assuming you didn't understand what, to her, seems obvious. But how could you, if that's not your area of interest? Obviously, that's why you asked questions about it, but i think her responses (which seemed to be rather pretentious, in the sense that she mistook your interest in learning more as stupidity or being dense) were rather dismissive, and indirectly ruined the conversational growth."
Blows my mind... those question marks are because they are legit confused by conversation
Looks like she just assumed you should already have known. Hate this mindset
"This reminds me of the 4 chicks that just unmatched with me. Why date, when you can enjoy life with a dog, a cat, a spider or snake....!"
"Follow up with, ""so is that one of the pigs you care for in your profile pic?"""
She will love you forever for that.
People like this aren't worth your time. Learn quick and move on so you can spend your time on quality people looking for the same things as you
"She's just giving you quick, ""already bored with this convo"" responses while checking out other guys. Here's a tip, try to come up with random and spontaneously interesting topics."
"Don't ask her too many questions regarding what she's studying, unless she seems very interested in those topics, which she clearly is not."
That’s basically how the only convo I had went.
"You could always open with the ""kill one, sleep with one, marry one""  game... It's fun and depending upon which three people you give her, you may just learn something too!"
Dude you're supposed to just have telepathy and automatically know what she means and not ask any questions. Get with the program
"Nah. Just poor social skills. Trust me, she did you a favor."
Bro after three responses like this; do yourself a favour and stop messaging or unmatch her. She's only gonna waste your time. She's not looking. She's looking for an entertainer and I doubt that's your job even if it was - she's not paying you.
"See a lot of us guys put up with this horseshit and as long as we do, they'll keep doing this. Stop. Don't give them the power or satisfaction and slowly it'll stop happening"
Farm animals.....lol
"If you hadn't left the name uncovered I'd have been convinced this was my ex. Red flag dude just move on, you used a good starter question and asked good follow ups. Her loss king"
Ask her if she wants to bang.
"It's not your fault, she just seems exceedingly confused by everything."
they seem a bit dense
"Match and mirror. She wasn’t interested in texting, look how short her responses were and look how you were responding. I would have acted just as un interested as she was ."
"She kills the conversation- she’s straight answering your questions  with two or three words top, not showing any kind of “excitement”, and not asking anything at all."
IMO- doesn’t matter how attractive she is. Move one. It’s better to establish a conversation with someone who shows more interest in you. It will flow naturally.
"Ah, yes, the classic ""brick wall."""
idk see what the point in matching with you if she was just gonna be dryer than a popeyes biscuit
"Oh Jesus. if someone responds to your question with an answers followed by a question mark insinuating that’s it’s common knowledge and that you should’ve  known that info, get out quick. Rude as fuck. Block that waste of time and keep swiping."
Low energy.
"Years ago I had one like this that I thought wasn't interested until she invited me to ""visit"". Just turned out she had horrible communication skills.  Ask her, be direct."
"Wow, I didn’t know they had ritz crackers on tinder. That convo was dry as fuck"
"I mean people are saying the conversation was dry anyway, which it was, but like what the hell are you supposed to talk about right? Dating apps perplex me, such an unnatural way of interacting with another human being lol"
"Seems like she's testing your ability to keep a conversation going or she's playing hard to get. Either way, you've done a great attempt and shouldn't feel bad about re-swiping her the other way. Happy swiping!"
The only thing that would have made this worse was if she initiated the conversation. I've had that happen to me so many times it's not even funny.
"I mean, idk if the schools are structured the same over there but there’s a clear difference between a pet vet and a livestock vet over here; totally different schools at times. Thus making the question completely legit imo. It’s basically asking “will you smell like shit all the time, or puppies?”."
She sucks
I give back massages to crickets....its a very fulfilling career.
Ask her if she likes butt stuff
"I studied animal care and there's loads she could of spoken about if she actually wanted to, she definitely wasn't interested in this conversation."
Yea she's definitely a c#nt lol
"Honestly, I think if you rephrase your questions differently you’d get better results. Ask “whats the most interesting thing you’ve done?” instead, that way she has to gives you an interesting response from you can answer to. The way you phrase that question gives her the option to say things like not really. Try staying away from yes and no question and expand!"
"To play decils advocate ahead probably saw you ask a ""boring"" question and wanted something more exciting. She could have said that but for a guy this will be very common"
"You are dealing with a useless non-intellectual human...she wants dick or possibly just validation and an ego boost.  Tell her she looks nice and you'll come over and lay pipe right now.  Otherwise stop wasting your time and go build something (physical, mental, spiritual etc...)."
I think she’s not interested.
"Regardless of who liked what in the conversation, it’s one sided and that’s the only hint you need on what to do. Next. You won’t have to TRY to talk when you find someone that clicks with you."
Maybe they dont want to talk about the thing that stresses them. you were pushing for something they are interested in for themselves. Push for other topics and no not their looks i dont need people telling me i look good i already know.
She’s just not that interested bro
"It means she'd already have messaged the group chat about ""the hot guy in the airport"" if she saw you there, too."
"This, if you meet the rule 1."
"Or, is just the group chat in her head of all her personalities."
"Whew, I have a great story about a girl at an airport."
"But this is about you, OP. It means this is the one."
More likely talked to them about the creep staring at her
Alternatively it could be 'This creep is watching me from across the terminal'
It means she would have talked to her friends about you…
Maybe it’s just low self esteem but that’s not explicitly clear whether it’s good talk or bad talk
This
"there’s a creepy guy staring at me at the airport, and now he’s on my flight"
"That’s actually really sweet & pretty original, aww."
"Not calling this a repost, but this line has been posted here before. It is good though"
Agreed - great pick up line lol
I've been copy/pasting this line for about a month now. I put my own spin on it though.
I've got this in my notepad app under OLD Pickup lines I've been copy/pasting this line for about a month now. I ended up putting my own spin on it though. It's been pretty successful as far as getting an initial response so far.
It’s not original though. There’s basically a trend on TikTok about airport girls
How many things could this mean?
"Flirting, comparing, kidnapping, recruiting, laughing,..."
Please take your W and leave sir
Means you’re attractive and would be thought of fondly
Clueless my guy
😂😂 why did this make me laugh so hard
Best part is OP has used it for a month and still doesnt know what to do.
I mean it's pretty obvious the guy would get talked about but it's not clear if it's a positive or a negative.
Just wanted to flex for karma
It means she’d be texting “there’s a hot guy on my flight” to her friends.
This is a good thing!
People making fun of OP for not understanding. I’m fucked.
She’s saying that if she saw him on the plane she’d be telling her friends about the cute guy on the plane
Fr I'm just as clueless as OP
"i’m making fun of him for posting here, after sending a copy pasta. no originality, no autonomy. just wants to be guided. why is he on tinder if he can’t even have a conversation.. oh wait"
Well don’t leave her hanging
You’re in dog
Ladies check out this FREAK in the airport?
You slow af bruh haha
Lol I thought this would be obvious
Def met rule 1. Go for broke homie.
What's rule 1?
"Its clearly her matching what you said. If you're asking for reddit help on this...bud, you done."
Unfortunately. Those aren't people.
Try not to try and allow it to get to you. You definitely realize all you really want to be aware of that people character from that terrible comment
She’s probably an insecure gremlin
She's probably a guy using catfish pics
"""I just wanted to be polite, but I guess that's that"""
Shouldve answered: Beat me to it again
This is the way.
LMFAO I AM GONNA REMEMBER THIS FOREVER
Well done
"To get the same message as you sent them to lift up their ego. You shouldn't just say ""Ok..."" That's even better for them, instead try to find a clever way to tell them how shitty if a person they are"
What’s your name ?
What…
What is your name ?
Tony
Fuck you Tony…
Is it really worth the effort. She already got the dopamine rush and the ego boost. Just unmatch and move on with your life
"They are being shitty on purpose. If you try to insult them and get angry, they will know they hit a nerve. That's the reaction they are going for. Ignoring or giving a neutral, uninterested response is much better. I have seen the weird insults men send to women trying to hurt them. At no point have any of them actually hit me. I just found it funny how pressed they were. Unless it's coming from someone they liked, women laugh at this kind of stuff"
"Nah, beat then before that. When you receive a compliment, just say ""Thank you!"" This is actually better when really complimented as well. Then if they respond they were JK or w/e head games, you have all the advantage. In fact, you can even respond ""Thanks"" again and leave them puzzled. Even better if you never respond again."
"Whenever someone tries an ambush like this (which is pretty rare) I just laugh at them. Nothing deflates a bully faster than laughter. So maybe instead of ""thanks"" just an ""lol"" and go no contact."
Yeah I try to it’s just in the moment my mind goes blank and can’t think of anything to say
"Yeah, something like ""Damn, you beat me to the punch line""."
"I'd just say ""So was I"" and be done with it"
Hundred percent. Beautiful on the outside. But clearly rotten shit on the inside
"Just don't respond, haters gonna hate not worth your time yo"
Lashing out just makes it look like they got ya
"Dude that’s a terrible idea. Getting mad just shows that you care and they got to you, giving them even more satisfaction. Just don’t respond, at most unmatch. That is the only real way to get back at them."
"Also side note: if you’re brain defaults to trying to insult them you honestly might want to analyze yourself and see if you have anger issues. Do you get in arguments online a lot? I used to be like that and you will be infinitely happier in life if your approach is just to remove yourself from antagonistic situations and not respond to people trying to bait and troll and make you upset. Block people online, don’t respond and unmatch people on dating apps, etc."
You can feel satisfied that you took the high road. You would otherwise jusr feel even shittier when they inevitably respond more antagonistically and make you feel more upset and ruin your day. By taking the high road you will also irk them more than you could in any other way because you getting angry is what they want. They want to hurt other people and get in arguments. Don’t let them.
So it really is true beauty is only skin deep.
"""Same lol, you just came off as desperate enough for an ez lay"""
"Nah then it validates their original assholery. If you are kind they feel even shittier. A ""well i wish you the best, sending love and light and peace your way"" crushes their soul."
Invite them to drink piss and vomit from a cup made of their own shit.
"Well, the jerk store called and they're running out of YOU!"
"""I just wanted to be polite, but I guess that's that"""
"""And I was just being polite lol"" to mock the tone. I like your idea the best though, since it knocks down the ego of assuming it was anything more than a reciprocatory statement."
You could've replied with
redditor response
Meh
"Because they are miserable in their daily lives, probably because no one likes them."
"What exactly are you saying here? Is it that when a man who gets laid a lot and brags about it to friends, and a lady going on tinder specifically to insult people who try to ask them out, and then brags about it to people is the same thing? Or somehow comparable at all?"
"They aren’t mean, they are dumb."
Should have said: you beat me to it again!
Fuck dat bitch
Don't
That’s the problem bro
"Probably ""it""was powerswiping, then you don't have anything too loose if you match with person below your criteria. And there is frustration, cause you don't match be with people who would you like....."
Boredom/frustration I suspect. Or maybe she is just being playful and hopes you are too. Who knows.
"Either way, move on if it’s not your type."
"Would consider it playful if a girl said ur good looking and then said ""syke lmao"". Doubt it."
"Yikes r/nicegirls or in a few more years be raging in some other femcel sub like fds complaining that all men are trash & only want sex or some other bs cuz they choose shit men while treating decent guys like this. Gents teach your daughters how to be proper ladies so they don't turn out like this. Teach your sons to be proper men so they don't get hurt by trash like this ""woman"" & just realize they dodged a psychotic bullet."
"Screw her king Glory of the emperor is eternal, tits are temporary"
Because they absolutely hate themselves and the only way they think anyone is going to compliment them is for them to trick you into doing it.
"Anything anyone says, whether good or bad, is a reflection of how they feel about themselves. Don’t ever take anything personally."
Someone who goes on an app for people looking to connect with others and goes out of their way to be mean spirited to perfect strangers isn't a happy person.
"""I was also just kidding lol, We'd make a great couple."""
Lmao tinder is for the unwell
Don’t even let it get to you. You already know all you need to know about that persons personality from that nasty remark.
"""I was just being polite as well :)"""
With a capital C
Fuck you Jessica
"Lol what a fucking bitch, she knows it too"
DICK MOVE!
And this is why hot people act like they don't give an eff.
"Fuck you, Jessica"
She’s probably an insecure person🤔
"Because the usa creates a culture of consumerism. We must have the best and latest things, the most money, the best job, the nicest car, the most attractive bf/gf and we must be the most attractive. If not, society tells us that we arent good enough. And instead of creating a culture of love and acceptance and group support, it creates a individualism society that I must win at all costs and if there is more for you there is less for me. We have the most depressed and anxious people in the world, the most people on pills, and the most people in prison. So how do people react? They put others down to make themselves feel better. There are millions of lonely dudes that in other countries would be treated well by women but here are scoffed at when they admit to being attracted to someone. And they give billions of likes to every girl on social media, so this creates a fake reality for even a half way attractive woman to think that her shit doesnt stink. This allows her femininity to weaken and become cold and harsh to men who are kind to her, and to search out assholes. Then it causes men to treat women like assholes because many dont respond well to being treated with respect. It becomes a game payed between two jaded people where authenticity and vulnerability dont exist. Which are the two most important things a healthy  relationships to survive. So thats why people are mean for no reason. You didn't deserve this treatment. Sending love and light and peace your way."
"P.S. if the above doesnt apply to you, keep moving along. There are exceptions to every rule. But most people arent the exception even when their ego says they are."
Should’ve replied as : I was kidding too hahaha
"Wow, what the fuck! OP, seriously, fuck her for never evolving past elementary school. She’s seriously doing it to boost her ego, it’s what bullies get off on. I’m sure you’re extremely cute!"
Thank you really appreciate it means a lot!
"Usually when people are rude I look at them in disbelief and say ""Theres no way you're actually this rude"" they always have that look where they reevaluate themselves."
"I hate this so much. Guys do it but I particularly hate it when women do it because we try so hard to say we don’t want our physical appearance constantly picked apart, so it seems cruel and hypocritical at the same time. As an observer I’d love for you to go back with something mean and personal, but realistically I’d have responded on the exact same way! I’d also have an a big high when she said something nice and a huge drop when she said she was kidding and would think about it for a week. Do me a favour and don’t let this get to you, try to delete it from your memory and carry on being a kind soul!"
"God damn, I would bring her ego below sea level if she dared to say that, thats really dissrespectful what a whore"
Because they read an article (or worse paid to do a course) about 10 years ago that said that women love it when you're mean to them and it will make them try harder to impress you.
"They haven't realised that ""negging"" was never really successful"
"She was the one ""negging"" what are you on about."
Why you gotta be so rude?Don't you know I'm human too?I'm gonna marry you anyway.
It’s bitches like her that make men want to turn us into lamps and body suits 🙄
Next time this happens try relentless optimism Instead of complimenting them back say thank you you and if they say they didn't mean it just say the fact that it's believable is good enough for you
"what does that have to do with anything.. label her whatever you want, that was just a dick move"
Seriously what is the point of this
BITCH why all this shut-down negging
r/femaledatingstrategy 101
"""Thank God, I was just returnig the compliment to not be mean but wasn't even interested. Bye"" unmatch"
F
"Just block people like this. They are being mean on purpose. Sometimes it's a group of girls at a party swiping on guys to make fun of them. I have seen that happen. The best thing you can do is to not react. I see a lot of comments telling you to say something mean or tell her you were kidding too. Don't. She knows it's not true. Angry reactions is what they are going for. Any insult you could send back isn't going to hurt her, it will just entertain her. Unless it's coming from someone they liked, women probably just think it's funny"
Shame her outside clearly doesn't match her inside... In a few years the outside beauty will have passed and she will finally be an ugly bitch outside and in
First reply should've been 'love me a girl with low standards'
What’s funny to me is that the people that do this are rarely high on the looks scale. Just insecurity and nastiness. You dodged a bullet.
"Some people build their entire personality around hating things. Others - the good kind, build parts of their personality around liking things. Don’t be the former."
"That was just purely mean, she didnt had to be like that, if she or he didnt want to begin a story why wasting people energy ?"
Tinder seems like an absolute cesspool
Report and block
Jessica you slime
“ Oh thank god so was I “
Lol she could’ve been throwing banter back at you gotta keep it rollin
I would just full counter then
Why does everyone's tinder UI look so different
"Next time just say ""you're welcome."""
"""OH, you're one of those people. Damn, I'm sorry dude. Things will get better."""
My fav reply when I meet these sad clowns (luckly rare at my age).
Beat you to it again
What a dazzling display of cuntness
Do a face reveal
Damn you guys take Tinder way too much seriously
Your father isn’t present in your life is he?
Lmao. I would never fall for something like this.
What if it’s a dude pretending to be Jessica?
You should’ve said “lol me too.”
"Wretched creatures praying on others pain for their own twisted satisfaction, they are not people."
Type this: wow you are my type!🥰  I usually go for insecure girls who didn't get enough attention from their dad. At what age did your dad leave you?
Because some people are just plain bad
How you gonna let an unverified account hurt your feelings. That could be anyone.
"What a missed opportunity to say,”great minds think alike”"
Should've just said same
I was also going to say I better your inner beauty is just as beautiful as your outer…. But you’ve proven that wrong! Good thing I didn’t say it
"But if you accept it to be true, then get butt hurt that they were kidding, doesn't that make you somewhat of a narcissist? Do you think they wouldn't choose Thor over you?"
"Well, maybe I'm gonna get flamed but, but down here (Mexico) that's not common, in the US it is, maybe because your values as society are going down"
🎵Thank you for being a BITCH.🎵
"Looks like she needs an attitude adjustment, or a self-worth devaluation of sorts. The best revenge would be seeing her become a MeToo victim with a sob story, and then men not giving a shit about her."
Dear jessica… fuck off!
Probably not a girl.
It's a dude with a hot chick's pics.
"He baits, then trolls the dudes that fall for it."
BRUH LMAO
"When you respond rudely then it validates their original assholery. If you are kind they feel even shittier. A ""well i wish you the best, sending love and light and peace your way"" crushes their soul."
Lmaoo never trip out over a bitch named Jessica bruh
"Girls do these things to get a response. Guys such as yourself that end the conversation right away do not get to smash, guys that come up with a clever response get to smash"
"negging apparently hooks the girls with issues. it's not you, it's society."
"She’s fighting some battles, trust me your ahead here."
"“What this means, quite simply, is they aren’t looking for a man (so, it’s a waste of time to use this method to find a woman). At best, they are looking to have their egos stroked by saying no to all the men who seem to be interested in them and then will have an anonymous sexual encounter with some random loser, when they have been too long without love, sex or intimacy (ie they binge). At worst, these psychos are looking to actively harm someone, any way they can, as long as it is safe for them.”"
"they have a shit life, don't worrie about what people say when they act like that. they just do it because they hate them selfs."
"This made my heart sink. I’m sorry OP, I have no idea why people are so mean."
Lmaooooo
Neg101 and failing
Keep at it king 👑. You got this
"To assert dominance, you should’ve said something kinda douchey or cocky like why wouldn’t you 😂she would’ve replied w nudes"
Nasty!
I'm a little confused... This just seems like some light roasting. Unless she got mad or catty at a similarly roasty response then why the butthurt?
it’s hard to believe that someone can go out of their way to be so nasty… I hope you don’t let it get to you. I’m sure you’re lovely!
"Should've said, ""Me too."""
Christ second time tonight that I'm blown away but at the same time not even shocked at how horrible women are these days
"""If you have Haye in your heart, let it out...."" Dave Chappelle"
Ok was actually the best response because it shows they are immature and you’re not going down to their level.
Not quite sure about that one
Yeah nah i think you'll have to go back to the drawing board with that one.
Welcome to the world snowflake
Cos you are actually ugly she would never say that otherwise. 😄 🤣
Its funny bcos its true.....
She skipped all the bs and skipped right to the part where you tell her exactly how you feel.
We'll you definitely won't be getting laid in the next few weeks with this one.
He played himself lol
Few weeks? I had mine done 6 weeks ago and I’m just about ready to start fucking again. Can’t be rushing this stuff 😂
Mine was for different reasons though not because it was dirty. Bit of an over share on his part this early on
I knew a guy who got circumcised as an adult too! Apparently the foreskin was pretty tight and he was getting yeast infections (yes men get yeast infections in the head of their penis)… so yeah. Just sharing lol
The guy is you isn't it.
Yeast infections on a male can be an indication of diabetes. The yeast really like the sugar if your glucose is high.
"Source: I'm an uncircumcised diabetic and this was actually how I found out I'm diabetic, my Dr suspected it and tested me."
Phimosis
At least it wasn’t creepy. I was really expecting creepy. That might’ve been the most casual conversation switch to talking about his dick.
Indeed BoiledPeen
How does one enjoy their last days with foreskin? Asking for a friend
"Not by having conversations like this, for sure"
Stroke it tenderly and tell it how much you'll miss it when it's gone but not to worry because you'll always remember the good times you've shared together.
Uh stare and appreciate..?
he is using his foreskin as a pacifier before it gets cut off
You play with the cheese one last time
Generally you squeeze it and pretend your penis is talking
Probably play 'hide the pimento' with the dog one last time
He can ask doctor to don't blend foreskin for a cream after surgery and instead of it glue it to his fingers. New dick but old ways lol
“Honest to a fault”
Your guy doesn't wash.
"Dude: “every time I take my car outside it gets dirty, so I guess I have to get a new car”"
I shudder to think what his doctor would recommend for preventing jock itch.
"Exactly my thought. If you have a good hygiene, the foreskin can stay."
"No. This guy doesn't wash his fleshlight.  My best friend's brother has had a UTI for over a month now because he never washes his fleshlight, and he finishes inside it.  But he also only showers maybe once every two weeks."
"Google phimosis, it sucks"
"Imagine deciding to have a medical procedure to surgically remove skin from your penis instead of just, ya know, washing it."
How on earth do you go from talking about baked sweets to letting a complete stranger know that your awful hygiene has made your foreskin so gross that the doctor just recommends cutting it off?
"Don't listen to people in this thread, it's not necessarily that he doesn't wash. He can have phimosis"
Yeah homie doesn’t wash his dick.
He probably thinks that before he falls in love with you you should learn about the shape of his dick. Maybe one would say no to that..
"I mean,  at least you know he's honest"
I was circumcised at birth so I have no recollection of it. I read a lot about how there are a lot of nerves in the foreskin that's removed and how circumcision makes sex less pleasurable. Sometimes I think about that and I'll start to feel a little bad that I don't get to experience that but then I remember that I never have so I literally don't know what I'm missing and then I don't care again. I'd hate to have gone through my life having that experience and then having it taken away from me in the middle of my prime. I think he could probably just take better care of shit down there but what do I know.
His foreskin isnt why hes getting utis lol his nastyness is
If he cant retract the foreskin due to phimosis than hes not nasty…just needed to be circumcised earlier.
At least he's brutally honest?
Insert blink 182 wtf meme here
What meme is this?
Adams dong
LooL I’m so confused because where did he expect this to go?
who just randomly brings up their foreskin
I had a guy do it once. Just randomly told me he has too much foreskin.
Done.
Wash your dirty dick you schmuck
"LOL, You do know what a schmuck is?"
"Well, in Yiddish, it is the part being discussed."
Bro. Clean your dick more often wtf... that's why you're having UTI
"Pretty sure a doctor told him that the first time. My coworkers baby kid just had to get circumcised because of frequent UTIs, and she was doing the cleaning."
It happens…
"Imagine not knowing what phimosis is, and judging people because of thinking we know everything."
Whoa that's freaking wild
"Well you are taking about bananas, so, happy banana day"
I mean respect for him saying it as a natural thing although the timing is and context lol. But love it even more that you said convo transitioned to dirty banana 🍌 hahahahah
Dude admitted to not washing his dick lmao.
Tongue his skin flap before its too late fam
"Fr Adam, you just tell people about your nasty dick?"
Circumcision isn’t always necessary to cure tight foreskin. A man can always ask a doctor to prescribe a steroid cream or if that doesn’t work ask to have a small incision done to loosen the skin. They can massage the skin after warm shower and carefully stretch it on a regular basis.
If I had the choice I would keep mine intact. I was pissed that my parents made that choice for me. It was definitely grounds for divorce with my ex-wife of her wanting a potential son to go through that torture.
Lol if hes getting UTIs its cause he doesn't wash his dick. Run Away!!!
Source: I am uncircumcised.
"That means he needs to clean it, not that he needs it removed."
I disagree with the body shaming but as someone who has been denigrated in the past for a decision my parents made when I was a newborn it’s interesting to see that go the opposite way for once
Sincerely fuck you.
"Late circumcision is very dangerous. It is incredibly stupid to do it as an adult, and is only necessary when medically required (if your dick is actually fucked up, not UTIs)."
When you say this are you referring to people advocating for or against MGM ?
What do you mean ? Do you think parents should mutilate their children's genitals ? Do you think that's better than teaching basic hygiene ?
Don’t fuck him. Homeboy doesn’t know how to clean himself properly if he’s getting that many UTIs
His urologist is wrong...
WHy dO tHeY aLwAYs GhOSt?
He is going to miss his forskin and he should wash it more often.
Seems a bit extreme to maintain an aversion to washing
Ain’t no way
He just needs to dip the tip in bleach.
Because that’s totally something to say on Tinder lol at least he’s honest
At least he's a honest one!
"It’s a trick, send no reply."
He doesn't wash his banana very well apparently.
What in the world....
He's in for 2 weeks of being very uncomfortable. No long walks in the park and no jerking the chicken. He should enjoy it the last few days.
How the fuck exactly a day of enjoying foreskin would look like.
"Hey at least you know he’s an honest man, who just says that to a stranger 😂"
Why you gotta do him dirty like that and post it?
"aaah yes, the fool proof ""im getting circumcised"" ice breaker"
WAAAAY different context than I expected.
Tell to explore every other option before getting circumsized. He will more than likely regret it a few months after
🤢 🤮 that is so wrong. Why would any women have sex with him when he literally said he gets frequent UTIs. On to a different note: there wasn’t any hint of sexual tension for him to talk about his D  🤦‍♂️ unless that it was mentioned from previous texts
At least you found out before you were the one getting UTIs 💀
"I think he was always at least referring to his ""dirty banana"""
Why would foreskin cause a UTI?
That escalated quickly
the forbidden peel
"I'm a Jaded gay man, so fellas, don't hate me. That's men for you.... If one thing reminds them of their manhood or sex... The only thing they think about  is the same thing, they're thinking with."""
I’m just questioning why he wasn’t already circumcised.
"Well...I mean, if we look at the good side, his penis will be a lot cleaner after he did circumcised. So, it should be safer for any girl who wants to ride him later in the future. 👀"
So did you beg him not to get circumcised cause you love anteaters?
Did he think his UTI was gonna turn you on? 😭
He's peeling his banana after it went brown.
PSA: wash ya dicks ya dirty fucks.
He probably should have lied about the reason.
I don't think that guy was trying to get any letting that cat out of the bag
Hey at least you know he's honest....i suppose
at least he’s transparent
He’s probably nervous and is not a tell a friend kind of convo. Sometimes internet friends are good for those tough conversations
"This was probably the 5th msg we had exchanged, the conversation literally just started! 😂"
You should of said that your banana bread wont be rising in my over or something like that 😆
😂😂🤣🤣 I’m ☠️
"""So I'm wondering if you'd like to give the ole foreskin one last hurrah before it gets the chop""..."
"Circumcision in almost every case isn't useful for stopping UTI's, and it causes nerve damage, and can also cause loss of sensation, Erectile Dysfunction, and in some cases deformation. Given the choice knowing all that, I wish I wasn't circumsized, but at 2 days old it's hard to object to unnecessary cosmetic surgery."
"And kids, this is how you crash a parked car!"
Hello sexy banana
No one better call me an over-sharer ever again.
dirty banana is one of my favorite drinks lmao
Circumcision prevents so many bacterial things and even lowers the chance of getting HIV and other STDs.
This is what open masculinity looks like lmao
Gross. He has to learn to clean himself.
There is zero medical reason his foreskin would be causing UTIs unless he's doing weird ass shit and never washing but that has nothing to do with his foreskin.
This makes me happy mine was doneb at birth
Surprised the guy didn’t say something like “once it heals you can suck it to make sure it still works”
Luckily you cross outed Kziah's name.
Crossed out.
"Yeah, good thing. Or else we would know that they’re 25."
"As long as her idea of good tequila isn't Cuervo, I like her"
That’s hot
classy
That’s one hoping for a thick larvae
I like her.
original
I volunteer
She belongs to the streets lol
"These hoes ain’t for the streets, these hoes for the earth 🌎 😂"
Thats a rental; not a lease or purchase type agreement.... Bitch be like Hertz; always letting strangers in
With salt and lime?
"This is how you get vore""d"
yes this is vore
Mom?
That’s a keeper
"This is a cute photo. But idk why it gives vibes of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" like this was the last known photo of the couple before the disappeared"
"Thank you. Now that you mention it, it does kind of look like a cut scene from a crime mystery haha."
"Congratulations, I hope I can post this one day 🤞🏼"
i hope too that I'll comment this on your post that day
"Thank you, Keep at it! They will come along."
"I love seeing these posts. Met my husband on tinder too. He had a cheesy opener, two years after we matched (I was no longer even active on tinder)."
"Four years together, one year married, 1 kid and another on the way:)."
He took 2 years to message you? Wow that’s playing the long game 😂
Congratulations!
I posted something like this once.  My wife was furious.
"So many questions like ""why are you on tinder"" and ""who the hell is Brittany?"""
Hahah
What was your opener?
Are you my appendix? Because I would like to take you out. (occupational opener)
Am I the only one who feels like these stories from tinder were much more possible 5 years ago than they are in the state it’s in today?
"5 years ago I many great experiences on tinder, but I wouldn’t touch that app today. I just feel like other apps provide better experiences. Plus tinder is all about the money now."
Definitely not the only one. I've been a lurker/commenter of this sub for a while and things have changed drastically since I was in the Tinder game.
No. Im wondering why you feel that way?
"Tinder owns all of the major apps, btw. Maybe you aged out of that demographic, but still, you'll find most people use them all."
"As a 30 something, take it as you will. The apps are all how you treat them."
"That's good man congratulations. I will find my person one day. Not on tinder tho. Fuck tinder, lol. Terrible place filled up with terrible people. I applaud you for sifting through thousands of piles of shit to find a decent human on tinder. I lost patience long ago, now I just come to this sub for laughs."
Thank you. Meet them doing a hobby is the best start! Right off the bat you know you have a common interest.
"Not sure if you're the guy or girl in the Pic, but the guy looks like an friend of mine... That you Matt? If it is, your wife looks a lot like my wife's cousin that you crushed on at my wedding 12 years ago and then you didn't ask her out."
I wish I were. That would make a great story. Unfortunately I'm not Matt though.
The whites settling
Incredible!!! I wish you all the best!!
Thank you
I reversed the 5 years and 2 kids in my head and thought y'all had twins twice
Dear God no. 2 is enough haha.
Congrats!
You two must'a made some gorgeous children!
"All the best, Mozaltov!"
Thank you. We sure did.
Congrats!
You two must'a made some gorgeous children!
"All the best, Mozaltov!"
Looking like I’m on the same path. 5 years together looking at houses currently 🥲
Congratulations!
Congratulations guys!! That's so wholesome!! Here have my free wholesome award! :)
Thank you kind stranger
Woahh really a perfect match from an online app. Congrats and Stay inlove!
Thank you
And are you still happy
"Yes. Marriage is a rollercoaster. Certainly has its ups and downs. But, I wouldn't change anything."
That's all that matters nothing but the best to you and your family
Thank you
Thank you

Your welcome
Ah you're taller than her. Makes sense. Lol congrats.
Haha! Thank you
"And here I am, who will totally die alone, lol."
Haha you'll find them. Keep at it!

Cheers to your life together
Thank you
What was the line
"Are you an appendix because I would like to take you out """
Congrats! Goals right here. Hoping I’ll get the chance at posting something similar.
"Same here! 5 years together this year after a spontaneous Tinder date. Married for 3, 2 cats and a house! It's been amazing."
50% of marriages end in divorce.
Plot twist: It's a trick. He was after toes the whole time. And now he pretends to settle.
HAHAHAHAHA
He'd probably get off on some knee as well.
"“Damn, why do I keep getting rejected?”"
Did he stick around for the second verse?
I skipped the second verse because I didn’t want to give him the mouth option
Knees and toes!
KNEES AND TOES!
"When I was only 12, I had a guy message me on instant messenger, and ask me if I would give him head. I told him ""no, the best I can offer is a brain,"" and then I blocked him. Times haven't changed, at all. 😩"
At the age of 12 you thought of that? Damn!
EYES EARS MOUTH AND NOOOOOOOSE
No mouth Really didn’t wanna give him that option
Perfect response!
"I've started responding by asking how often this greeting works. Current trend, ""DTF?"" works abt 20%"
So no head?
No Head shoulders knees and toes eyes and ears and no mouth and nose
curb stomps skateboard
"Adorable, I love it lol"
"If I'm the match, I would continue it."
He has yet to respond but I will lyk if he does
👑👑👑
What about “My face is leaving in five minutes. Be on it.”?
Damn I'd totally steal this if I was fem lol
I think that’s the opposite of what she wanted 🤣

"Cringey, because your battery is on 2%."
"I would've responded, ""head head head"" like in the commercial."
"cringey joke to cringey man, equals out"
"Reply back ""Knees and toes!"""
And see how long he goes.
"Hopefully, this guy isn't Hannibal Lecter."
And if he picks Toes?
That is the correct response.
So no head?
I hate it how the tune started playing in my head as soon as I read it
Mad funny
Get a charger.
Don’t worry my phone is charging now
"Jesus Christ. My phone gets below 5% and just says ""low."" I didn't know it could even say that."
So what this post really says is that your phone is 2% not whole. Lol
Clever biatch. I like this.
Thank you:)
Usual I dislike man slander but this one is a goodie
I mean like it’s not a great opener no matter who sends it LOL😂😂😂
Man slander? How would this be man slander lol
Can’t hate on a dude for trying. It’s a numbers game sometimes.
"I have no issues with people using tinder solely to look for hookups, but how about a greeting first lol. Solely opening with just “head?” Is kinda disrespectful and dismissive of the fact I am a human in my opinion lol."
😆 🤣 😂
I thought it was funny🤷🏼‍♀️
Knees and toes.
"Head shoulders knees and toes, knees and toes,"
What was the rest of the song?
Eyes ears mouth and nose
I don’t wanna give him mouth that’s why I didn’t do verse two LOL
"Eyes, ears, mouth and nose"
No!!! No mouth for him!!!
I did
Your battery level is giving me anxiety
It’s charging now Do u feel better?:)
Ok but why is shoulders for your hair

Captain America walks in and sits down
"So, you thought you found a girl but she was just using your DMs for validation"
Hey sometimes getting the date is better than going on it
This happens too often 🥱
I know girls who have had tinder profiles for years and never met up with anybody they talked to on it nor every had any intention of ever meeting up with anybody on it. They still sign in from time to time and message some matches for no reason until they get bored though.
"Why? Who knows. I stopped trying to figure out women a long, long time ago. But, I will say that these ladies I know we're a big part of my inspiration in deleting tinder."
"""I don't take tinder seriously"". ""I don't want to spend too much time."""
"🙄 Bitch, why do you use tinder?"
We've all been there before. I'm sorry this happened to you
"This has happened everytime for me, don’t get it yet they still want to talk and seem to get pissed when I immediately lose interest"
my dating experience in a nutshell
Easy don't match with a girl ¯_(ツ)_/¯
Emotional Damage
"It has become a regular thing, maybe if every man unmatched the women who didn’t reply after a few days they would catch on and up their game. Men never Unmatch them in the hope that maybe one day they will message leaving them with a big list of matches to scroll through validating themselves and deciding if they will message. Fuck them off in a few days and they will soon get the message."
Weird way of saying you may be attractive with no interpersonal skills
The grind is real. Own it!
I know that feeling a little too well
Literally 9/10 times this happens.
He just like me fr
Ty-pi-cal
Honestly you’ll get numb to it getting ignored or getting 0 matches it’s just a thing for guys at this point
"Twice this week for me, fml"
This is too damn true lmao
You guys are matching with girls?
"She has actually been trying to contact you, just from the other side 👻👻👻👻"
